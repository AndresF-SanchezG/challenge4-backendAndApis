# URL Shortener Microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

# Targets

- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- Waiting:You can POST a URL to /api/shorturl and get a JSON response with original_url and short_url properties. Here's an example: { original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}
- Waiting:When you visit /api/shorturl/<short_url>, you will be redirected to the original URL.
- Waiting:If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain { error: 'invalid url' }
